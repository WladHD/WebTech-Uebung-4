                <span class="tm">Selectors</span> are patterns
                that match against elements in a tree, and
                as such form one of several technologies that
                can be used to select nodes in an XML document.

                A <span class="tm">Selector</span> represents
                a structure. This structure can be used as a
                condition (e.g. in a CSS rule) that determines
                which elements a selector matches in the
                document tree.
